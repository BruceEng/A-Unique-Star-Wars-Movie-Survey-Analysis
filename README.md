This was a fun project to take on!!

I think this will be a fun project to read through and make interesting discoveries even if you're not a Star Wars movie fan.

There are plenty of graph illustrations, some correlation analysis as well as hypothesis tests conducted.

Here's a sample of the questions answered in this report:

1. Regarding the six Star Wars movies released between 1977 and 2003; is the one preferred most by the surveyed viewers the same as the "FiveThirtyEight" team's choice - "The Empire Strikes Back"?

2. For the same six movies, what is the order of movie preference from first to sixth among the viewers surveyed?

3. Is there a relationship between movie preference and volume of people who watched the movies?

4. Do male and female viewers agree on the order of movie preference from first to sixth? Looking forward to check that one out!!

5. If there is a relationship between movie preference and volume of people who watched the movies, is it the same for males and females?

6. There are four age groups identified in the survey. Is there any difference in movie preference among age groups?

7. There are fourteen characters identified in the survey who were portrayed in some or all of the movies identified. Who were the top 5 most liked and the bottom 5 most disliked?
